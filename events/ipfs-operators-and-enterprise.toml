title="Build the web we want"
description="""
Recently, we deprecated our public gateway and it came to light that creators had been using our public gateway url, along with the CID, in their NFT metadata, instead of using the CID.

The decentralised and resilient web we want will rely on people embedding these new patterns into whatever they create and build on top of the protocol and we at Infura want to help in whatever way we can.

IPFS gateways are an important portal into the IPFS network, but running publicly
accessible IPFS gateways comes with great risk and responsibility. In this talk Matt

Pinata has solved for them.

description="""
For wallets, decentralized exchanges, DeFi insurer, or DAO management, most IPFS
applications are relying on HTTP. This setup allows applications to be accessible by
current web users, with minimal modifications. It also enables developers to leverage
common web engineering practice. However, these HTTP endpoints have to be secured, and
trust provided by the decentralized-network has to be carried to end-users. HTTPS is
not enough. This talk will present the setup of a browser based IPFS app.
